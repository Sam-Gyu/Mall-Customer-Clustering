# Mall Customer Clustering Comparison

This project compares two unsupervised machine learning algorithms — **KMeans** and **Hierarchical Clustering** — using **Mall Customers dataset**.
The goal is to segment customers based on their **Spending Score** and **Annual Income**.

## Features
- Clustering Algorithms Compared
  - **KMeans Clustering**
     - Used Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters.
     - Visualized results using colored scatter plots.
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**
     - Used Dendrogram to find optimal number of clusters.
     - Applied **Agglomerative Clustering**.
  
- Evaluation
  - Both algorithms were visually compared using scatter plots.
  - Silhouette Score was used to determine clustering quality quantitatively.

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Scipy
